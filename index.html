<h2>Welcome to AccessScholar</h2>
<p>The growth of Digital Humanities, and the rapid proliferation of DH projects, in a  wide array of environments, has resulted the development of vast new sources of  primary source material, new services and new products for the connected scholar.</p>
<p>While some of the best of what current web technology has to offer has been  effectively conjoined with some of the finest humanistic scholarship, many of the  same limitations that plague the wider web have come along with those  technologies.</p>
<p>AccessScholar aims to be a venue for remediating some of those shortcomings,  specifically the ones that impact scholars with sensory deficits that may impair their  access to scholarship newly available in digital form.</p>
<p>AccessScholar will publish and disseminate accessibility standards, promote best  practices, serve as a clearinghouse for requests to update content for disabled users,  and maintain a crowd>sourced database of accessible primary and secondary  scholarly materials.</p>
