(Elements used in a page that perform nontraditional behavior.)

Â­Such controls can be executed with screen access software, and the user is provided with enough information to make good use of the control (e.g., a hypertext link, which traditionally takes one to a different page, is now used to select or highlight an item on the page; with screen access software, the user is able to determine which item on the page has been highlighted).
